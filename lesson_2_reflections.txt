When you initialize the respository for GIT it creates the structure and behind the scenes stuff to prepare to use GIT hub.  That is just a guess lol.

Staging area is only a temporary place for files to be commited.  Its purpose is to acts as the intermediate layer between GIT and your working dir.

The staging area is a good management system that clearly shows you what is to be commited.  Using git status is a clear indicator of what will be moved.

Branches can allow you to experiement and create new things while keeping your core functionalites intact.  If you need your project to "branch" off in a different direction you dont have to worry about it changing your original concept/core.

You can easily see what commits are made to what branches when you diagram them as such.  This can make you more organized.

Merging the branches together helped enable new functionalities that were worked on by different people.  Using the diagram really helps organize these commits and merges.

It is way faster to do automatic merges but there is not conflict resolutoin.  Therefore the process that was shown takes place.
